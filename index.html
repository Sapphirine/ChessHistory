            <p align="left">Chess is believed to have been invented in the 6th century, with early records of games following modern rules existing from the 1700s.
              The game has evolved significantly since then, with interest spiking at various periods of history. Chess was used by politicians to fight a proxy battle
              during the Cold War between the United States and the USSR, by computer scientists in the 1990s hoping to make progress in the field of artificial intelligence,
              and finally in 2020 by the entertainment industry to amuse us during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              Here I use <a href="https://chess-research-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">this dataset</a> to try to explore this rich history, mainly with the purpose of understanding trends in:

              <li><strong>ELO (player ratings): </strong> How have ratings changed over time?</li>
            </ol>
            <p align="left">
              Finally, at the end I look at head-to-head records for select players

          <div class="12u">
            <p align="left">The first couple moves in chess are referred to as the "opening". These moves dictate the tone of the rest of the game,
            and have been extensively analyzed by professional players for centuries. A player's choice of opening can be a reflection of
            the particular lines of play that s/he has studied, moves the opponent has not had much experience playing against, or of the type of
              game the player is trying to play (e.g. aggressive, risky vs. safe).
            </p>

            <p align="left">White always plays first in chess. Let's first look at the most common first moves selected by white over time.</p>

            <style>
            #first_move {
              width: 100%;
              height: 500px;
              margin-left:auto;
              margin-right:auto;
            }
          </style>
          <div id="first_move"></div> <br><br><br>

            <p align="left">Following white's first move, black will respond, and the game continues. The first few moves
            are usually played quickly as both players are aiming to achieve a particular opening sequence. Next, we will
            look at which of these openings have been most popular historically. Note, pause the simulation and mouse over
                the chart to see what the opening looks like. </p>

          <style>
            #bar_chart_race {
              width: 100%;
              height: 500px;
            }

          </style>
          <div id="bar_chart_race"></div>

            <br><br>
            <p align="left">Now that we know what openings were popular at various times in the past, let's try to understand how effective
                they have been when players used them. The chart below shows the ratio of wins for white, wins for black, and draws.
                You can hover over the various openings to see how the win rates vary. Note that the chart may look strange in the
                earlier decades due to lack of sample data.

            </p>


          <style>
              #win_loss_draw_ratio {
                width: 100%;
                height: 500px;
              }

          </style>
          <div id="win_loss_draw_ratio"></div>

            <br><br>
            <p  align="left">You can see why the Sicilian Defense is such a popular opening! It gives black the best chance of winning
            when white plays 1. e4. Similarly, the Indian Games give black the best chance vs. 1. d4. </p>

              <span class="byline">Exploring chess' rating system and player performance</span> </header>
          </div>
          <div class="12u">
            <p  align="left">The Elo rating system was created by physics professor Arpad Elo. An avid chess plaeyr, he worked with
                the US Chess Federation (USCF) to devise a rating system that better reflected player strength.
            The USCF implemented Elo's rating scheme in 1960, and it was adopted globally by 1970. </p>

            <p  align="left">The premise is simple - if you win a game, your rating will increase, and vice versa.
            The magnitude of the change is determined by the difference in your rating and your opponent's rating,
            as well as a "K factor", which can be arbitrarily set by the governing entity. At the moment, the USCF
            sets K factors differently based on player ratings. Low rated players have a higher K factor, meaning
            that their ratings jump more upon beating an opponent than a highly rated player would upon beating an
            opponent of similar relative strength. </p>

            <p  align="left">Elo ratings mean nothing in the absolute. They only have value when comparing them
            across players. Let's first have a look at our data to see how ELO ratings have evolved over time.
                Note that as mentioned above, ELO data only exists after 1970</p>

                <style>
        #data_summary {
          width: 100%;
          height: 500px;
        }

    </style>
    <div id="data_summary"></div>
              <br><br>
              <p align="left">It is clear that peak Elo ratings have been trending higher over time. There are several hypotheses behind why
              this is happening. The first is that this is due to overall "ratings inflation". As more and more people play chess,
              there is a larger pool of rating points for the strongest players to take advantage of. The other hypothesis is that
              players are just getting stronger. Particuarly with the advent of strong computer engines, players these days are
              able to train much more effectively. With computers, they can immediately get feedback during training on whether
              a move is strong or not.</p>

            <p align="left">So let's have a look at the strongest players and how their Elo has evolved. The chart below plots Elo
                over time for a selection of top grandmasters</p>

    <style>
        #player_ELO {
          width: 100%;
          height: 500px;
        }

    </style>
    <div id="player_ELO"></div><br><br>
       <p align="left">Garry Kasparov is not suprisingly the strongest chess player during the time period examined. Kasparov
       was world champion from 1985 - 2000 and maintained the highest Elo rating across nearly his entire career.
       We also see the beginnings of Magnus Carlsen's rapid rise in the ratings - he takes over the #1 spot in 2010.</p>

        <p align="left">But how accurate is Elo in predicting the result of a game? If ratings are an accurate reflection
        of player performance, we would expect the win rate to increase as the Elo gap increases between two players.
        One thing Elo does not take into account is the color each player is playing. We saw that white has an advantage
        in chess, so in a matchup of two equally rated players, the white player should outperform, but from the Elo
        perspective, chances of victory are exactly even. Let's have a look at the expected scores vs. actual scores.</p>

         <style>
        #ELO_accuracy {
          width: 100%;
          height: 500px;
        }

    </style>
    <div id="ELO_accuracy"></div><br><br>
                  <p align="left">We can see that for the most part, Elo does a pretty good job and predicting the outcome of games on average,
                  ignoring player color. However, when there are extreme gaps in rating, the lower rated player outperforms expectations.
                  This concludes the exploration of Elo ratings.</p>
